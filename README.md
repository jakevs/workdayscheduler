<h1>Work Day Planner</h1>
<h3>Project Details</h3>
<p>This was developed to help plan a normal work day schedule. When you are directed to website, the current date and time are presented at the top. There are several blocks where you can input text for a task, and save it. During work hours, the current time block should show red, the future blocks show green, and the past blocks will show gray.</p>
<h3>Working Details</h3>
<p>I used moment.js to get the time and date presented at the top, rather than try to do it with vanilla Javascript. I created the time blocks in HTML using a grid style pattern with columns and rows. The middle of the row is a text area where the user can input text, and save it with the button. I used JS, jQuery and CSS to get the time blocks to change into their respective colors. I used the jQuery click option and local storage to get the save button to work correctly, so that when it is pressed, it will exist even after a page refresh.</p>
